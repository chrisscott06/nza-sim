## Integration test results (Brief 12 — 2026-04-03)

**Bridgewater Hotel — Systems module full walkthrough**

### Part 1: 3D fixes ✓
- Z-fighting fixed: ContactShadows moved to y=0.02 (was -0.01, same level as ground plane)
- Walls: `#EBEBEB` clean light grey, roughness 0.9, matte finish ✓
- Glass: `#A8C8E0` consistent blue tint, opacity 0.35, visible from all angles ✓

### Part 2: System dropdowns ✓
- Fixed `l.type` → `l.category` for all three dropdown filters
- HVAC: 4 options, Ventilation: 3 options, DHW: 2 options — all populated ✓

### Part 3: Heating demand ✓
- Reduced `util_factor` from 0.75 → 0.60 (hotel 24-hour occupancy — less gains coincident with heating)
- Heating now shows 2 MWh (genuinely small for this cooling-dominated building with MVHR)
- Display shows "< 1 MWh" for very small non-zero values, "0" → "< 1" fix applied ✓

### Part 4: Accordion inputs ✓
- 5 collapsible sections: HVAC, Ventilation, DHW, Lighting, Small Power
- Single-expand mode with smooth CSS max-height transition
- One-line summaries update in real time (COP, MVHR HR%, setpoints)
- Teal left border + background tint on expanded section ✓

### Part 5: Systems flow data model ✓
- `systems_flow` in instantCalc returns nodes[] and links[] for Sankey
- 14 nodes, 11 links for VRF + MVHR + Gas Boiler config
- Conditional: MVHR recovery node/link, gas node, ASHP cascade link all conditional on config
- All links filtered to value > 0 ✓

### Part 6: Systems Sankey ✓
- d3-sankey (sankeyLeft) with string-based nodeId — critical: links reference string IDs not indices
- 11 links, 14 nodes rendered correctly at 1440×900
- Link colours: electricity=gold, gas=red, heating=red, cooling=blue, recovered=green dashed, waste=grey dashed
- MVHR recovery link visible (Recovered Heat node, green dashed path) ✓
- Footer: "Total site energy: 232.2 MWh/yr — Electricity 67% · 156 MWh / Gas 33% · 76 MWh" ✓
- ResizeObserver for responsive SVG ✓
- Badges: Detailed, MVHR (updates when mode/vent type changes) ✓

### Part 7: Node hover and click-to-expand ✓
- Hover: connected links brighten (+0.35 opacity), unconnected links dim to 0.08 opacity
- Unconnected nodes dim to 0.3 opacity — 300ms CSS transition
- Tooltip: node label, metric, in/out flows, COP multiplier, "click to edit" hint
- Click system node → expands corresponding accordion section ✓

### Part 8: Animations and badges ✓
- CSS `transition: 'stroke-width 300ms ease, stroke-opacity 300ms ease'` on all links
- Node dim/highlight: `opacity` with 300ms transition
- Mode badges: Detailed/Ideal Loads, MVHR/MEV, ASHP Preheat (when enabled)
- ASHP badge appeared instantly when preheat enabled — confirmed ✓

### Part 9: Systems live results ✓
- System efficiency section (only in Detailed mode): VRF COP 3.2×, MVHR 95% net HR, Boiler 92% eff
- FlowRow format: "X MWh in → Y MWh out" with colour-coded detail
- MVHR Heat Recovery callout: 71 MWh recovered, £3,550/yr gas saving @ 5p/kWh, ~17 tCO₂/yr avoided
- ASHP preheat callout appears when enabled; boiler label changes to "DHW System (Gas + ASHP)" with COP display
- Fuel split bar consistent with Sankey totals ✓

### Part 10: Integration test ✓
All checklist items:
- Z-fighting fixed: ✓
- Grey walls: ✓ (#EBEBEB)
- Blue glass: ✓ (#A8C8E0)
- Dropdowns populated: ✓ (4+3+2 options)
- Heating display: ✓ (shows 2 MWh, not "0 MWh")
- Accordion sections: ✓ (5 collapsible, summaries update live)
- Sankey rendering: ✓ (14 nodes, 11 links)
- MVHR recovery link: ✓ (71 MWh, green dashed)
- ASHP cascade link: ✓ (appeared when preheat enabled, EUI dropped 77→66)
- Animated transitions: ✓ (300ms on hover, link width, opacity)
- Click-to-expand: ✓ (Sankey node click opens accordion)
- System efficiency callouts: ✓ (VRF COP, MVHR recovery, boiler eff)
- Zero console errors: ✓

## Current state

### What's working

- **Systems Sankey** — proportional d3-sankey flow diagram, Grid/Gas → VRF/MVHR/Boiler/Lighting/SmallPower → end uses. MVHR recovery and ASHP cascade links shown. Hover highlights linked paths. Click node → expands accordion.
- **Collapsible accordion inputs** — 5 sections, single-expand mode, live summaries
- **System efficiency insights** — VRF COP, MVHR recovery MWh/£/tCO₂, boiler efficiency
- **3D fixes** — clean grey walls, consistent blue glass, no z-fighting
- **Solar units fixed** — solar gains now in kWh throughout heat balance; EUI responds to orientation
- **Orientation-sensitive EUI** — asymmetric glazing gives 3.2 kWh/m² swing 0°↔180°
- **Architectural 3D model** — white/grey massing, edge lines, recessed windows, base plate, contact shadows
- **Butterfly chart** — asymmetric heating/cooling gains, consolidated solar with hover tooltip, ↗ expand
- **Expandable Sankey** — full d3-sankey energy balance overlay in Building module, live-updating
- **Three-column live workspaces** — Building, Systems, Profiles
- **Auto-simulation** — triggers 3s after last change
- **Project persistence** — all params saved to SQLite
- **Full results suite** — Energy Flows, Energy Balance, Load Profiles, Fabric Analysis, CRREM & Carbon
- **Scenario Manager** — create/run/compare scenarios

## Known issues

- Building hardcoded as hotel_bedroom zone type — multi-zone not yet supported
- **uvicorn must be restarted** after backend code changes
- Full-year hourly data requires EnergyPlus .sql output file on disk
- MVHR raises cooling demand significantly in summer (physically consistent but counterintuitive)
- `SolarBars` component in `LiveResultsPanel.jsx` is dead code (function defined but never rendered) — harmless

---

## Suggestions

- Report export to PowerPoint/PDF using NZA template
- CIBSE TM54 benchmark integration — show building type comparison on Results dashboard
- Multi-zone building types (office, retail, hotel mix)
- Future weather files — climate change scenarios (+2°C, +3.5°C)
- Monthly weather visualisation (heating/cooling degree days per month)
- CSV export of simulation results
- "Duplicate project" in project picker
- Surrounding building massing for shading analysis
- Infiltration ACH from airtightness test (q50 → ACH conversion)
- EV charging demand modelling
- Clean up dead `SolarBars` function in LiveResultsPanel.jsx
- Node hover link labels (show kWh value on hovered links)
- Sankey link value toggle: absolute MWh ↔ percentage
- Natural ventilation mode in Sankey (bypass VRF for cooling)
