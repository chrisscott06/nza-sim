# Current brief

**No active brief.** Brief 76 just closed (`a6a5cc1` P2+P3, plus the close commit landing now). Brief 75 stays open with status "P2-only — superseded by Brief 76 P2" (the saturation diagnostic was correct that gains were saturating, but mis-attributed the cause; vent integrand was the upstream missing term, fixed by Brief 76).

Next brief is architect's call. Likely candidates:
- **Brief 77 — door bug** (operable door heat_loss=0 on Systems Heat Balance).
- **Brief 78 — interventions diagnostic harness**.
- **Brief 79 — WWHR**.
- **Brief 75 P3-P5 carry-forward** (decompose mech_vent_thermal_flow as standalone + MVHR recovery ribbon on IN side). Optional follow-on; the proximate-cause display is correct without it.
- Tier-3 carryovers logged at Brief 76 §future (EnergyCarbonTab v25 label reads; InterventionEditor dual-capture cleanup).

## Queued (not yet started)

- **Brief 70 Parts 2–4** — day-zoom + week-zoom + walkthrough close (Brief 70 Part 1 + adhoc polish landed; remainder pending).
- **Brief 72 P9 follow-on** — DHW load-shape toggle no-op investigation. Stub at [`docs/audit/72_p9_dhw_load_shape_followup.md`](../audit/72_p9_dhw_load_shape_followup.md). Two candidate root causes + 30-min investigation plan documented.
- **Brief 75 (renumber the door-bug placeholder)** — Operable door heat_loss=0 on Systems Heat Balance.
- **Brief 76 (queued)** — WWHR (needs a DHW end-use split first).

## Pending housekeeping (catalogued, not picked up)

Carried forward from the pre-Brief-71 list:

1. **Issue #24 polish trio** (see [`docs/audit/29_open_issues.md`](../audit/29_open_issues.md)).
2. **Performance polish** (Brief 44 Part 5d follow-ups).
3. **Sankey per-system share enhancement** (Brief 45 Part 3 deferred).
4. **Cross-route EUI baseline reading harmonisation** (Brief 45 Part 4 finding).
5. **Other /systems hard-coded MWh sweeps** (~6 sites in SystemsModule.jsx).
6. **PatchedInputBadge per-input coverage** in InternalGainsModule + OperationModule (Brief 47 Part 4 deferred).
7. **Per-row collapse-state persistence** (Brief 47 Part 5c deferred).
8. **Breakdown panel Level 3 leave-one-out** (Brief 48 Part 3 deferred).
9. **EnergyFlowsTab on Results** — separate parallel `annualEnergy` aggregation, auxiliary parity TBD (Brief 73 P5 §future).

## Paused

[`archive/30_dynamic_engine_rebuild_PAUSED.md`](archive/30_dynamic_engine_rebuild_PAUSED.md) — eligible for resumption when the Static work cycle pauses.
[`archive/67_zone_temperature_trajectory_PAUSED.md`](archive/67_zone_temperature_trajectory_PAUSED.md) — Part B paused with three modelling judgements flagged for Chris.
