# Current brief

**Brief 75 — Full ventilation heat modelling + Bridgewater heating-demand-zero diagnostic.** Architect to author. Picks up the Tier-3 follow-on from Brief 74 P6 close ([`docs/audit/74_bridgewater_over_gained_followup.md`](../audit/74_bridgewater_over_gained_followup.md)) — Bridgewater (4,125 m² UK hotel) reports `heating_demand_mwh = 0` which is implausible. Three candidate root causes (CIBSE defaults, zone heat-balance gain saturation, vent losses not feeding back into demand). Door bug renumbers to Brief 76; interventions diagnostic harness to Brief 77; WWHR to Brief 78. Do not begin work until the brief lands.

## Queued (not yet started)

- **Brief 70 Parts 2–4** — day-zoom + week-zoom + walkthrough close (Brief 70 Part 1 + adhoc polish landed; remainder pending).
- **Brief 72 P9 follow-on** — DHW load-shape toggle no-op investigation. Stub at [`docs/audit/72_p9_dhw_load_shape_followup.md`](../audit/72_p9_dhw_load_shape_followup.md). Two candidate root causes + 30-min investigation plan documented.
- **Brief 75 (renumber the door-bug placeholder)** — Operable door heat_loss=0 on Systems Heat Balance.
- **Brief 76 (queued)** — WWHR (needs a DHW end-use split first).

## Pending housekeeping (catalogued, not picked up)

Carried forward from the pre-Brief-71 list:

1. **Issue #24 polish trio** (see [`docs/audit/29_open_issues.md`](../audit/29_open_issues.md)).
2. **Performance polish** (Brief 44 Part 5d follow-ups).
3. **Sankey per-system share enhancement** (Brief 45 Part 3 deferred).
4. **Cross-route EUI baseline reading harmonisation** (Brief 45 Part 4 finding).
5. **Other /systems hard-coded MWh sweeps** (~6 sites in SystemsModule.jsx).
6. **PatchedInputBadge per-input coverage** in InternalGainsModule + OperationModule (Brief 47 Part 4 deferred).
7. **Per-row collapse-state persistence** (Brief 47 Part 5c deferred).
8. **Breakdown panel Level 3 leave-one-out** (Brief 48 Part 3 deferred).
9. **EnergyFlowsTab on Results** — separate parallel `annualEnergy` aggregation, auxiliary parity TBD (Brief 73 P5 §future).
